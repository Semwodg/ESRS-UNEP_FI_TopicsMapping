# ESRS-UNEP_FI_TopicsMapping
ESRS-UNEP FI Topics Mapping Knowledge Graph (under development)
## Purpose
To enable a reference set of topics as a graph contining both European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) topics, and the Impact Topics and Impact Areas of the UNEP FI Impact Radar (2022 edition).

Currently the mapping is drawn from the "expanded map" which includes the "Sub-sub topic" level of the ESRS topics.
